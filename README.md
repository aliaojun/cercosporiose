Streamlit is a Python framework for machine learning, data visualisation and building a beautiful online app in just a few lines of code.

This project is to build the visual data analysis platform needed using streamlit. To use the app you can click on the url related to the project description.

One of the challenges of machine learning is to understand how a model makes predictions and what features are important for its decision. A useful tool for this purpose is SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a framework that assigns a value to each feature based on how much it contributes to the prediction. One of the ways to visualize SHAP values is using a force plot, which shows the positive and negative effects of each feature on a single prediction or a group of predictions.

A force plot consists of a base value, which is the average prediction of the model, and an output value, which is the actual prediction for a given instance or group.
